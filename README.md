# discord_bot_template
This is just the discord bot template that I use when I want to make a bot. That way I don't need to re-write all of the code over and over again and can just start off from here.

If you do end up using my template, make sure to give credit so people know that I exist and made the template! <3

# Notes
If you want to use a different name in the client setup other than `TMP` and `tmp`. You can just change "TMP" to the new name and then find and replace all "tmp" occurrences with the new name.
